Document Object Model (DOM) - is our way of referencing elements in a document. In this case the document is the html page
we need to know what materials or elements are in a web page so that we can control their behaviours

HTML = allows us to define the structure or elements in a webpage
CSS = allows us to put aesthetic and other "beautiful" elements in a webapge
JS = allows to control the behaviours of our web page

what we are doing in CP2 will be very useful especially when you move to courses like System 3 - you will be deploying an information system

a website that is dynamic = there is a database where we pull data from and the other understanding is that you have a webpage that has different behaviour controllers 

there is a specific architecture (design pattern) that we call MVC (Model View Controller)

for example:
in instagram you have you mobile app, then there's your photos/stories, your contacts

model = is the data 
view = is the user interface
controller = is what you can do 

Drag and drop behaviours 

we have elements that are draggable = DOM model 
how it is displayed, where it is displayed = view
where you can move it etc = controller

by default, the script of HTML is JS

lets have a break and lets resume at 1108

javascript is a loosely-typed language

unlike c where we need gto define the vars
in JS there is no need to define
