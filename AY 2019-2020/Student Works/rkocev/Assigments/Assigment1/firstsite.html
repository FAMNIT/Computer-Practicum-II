<p>Description:<br>Originally the closing poem of The Animal Bride, “When I
Walk” precedes the last one of The Wild Awake, “Appetite,” a tightlyfocused description of eating honeycomb. Pleasure’s arrow at the
9
book’s start included “honey’s one sharp drop,” an image hinting
at ejaculation. Here the honeycomb, sensuous in the eating, signals
both time’s passing and the need to satisfy “your own yellow hunger.”
This hunger, however imperative, is large and diffuse.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h2>February Evening in New York</h2></a>

<p>Description:<br>This poem is so carefully put together. 
It has the appearance of being so free and easy like  a February evening itself might be stretching and changing,
 and yet I think one of the reasons it has such an impact on me is Levertov’s careful use of structure. 
The triple repetition of the phrases ‘As the…’ (good things always come in threes of course!) and then the change
 in that pattern (again many poems that move us suddenly ‘shift’ at the end – shift in direction or go 
‘into another gear’ – that’s the feeling anyhow) with ‘To the multiple disordered tones…’ 
Imagine if she had separated this poem out into stanzas, 
three beginning with ‘As the…’ and a final one at ‘To the multiple…’, what would be the effect on us as readers? 
How would the poem feel different? For me I think her choice to present the poem 
as one whole chunk (what poets sometimes called a ‘strophe’) is a considered one.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
