<p>
As the stores close, a winter light<br>
    opens air to iris blue,<br>
    glint of frost through the smoke<br>
    grains of mica, salt of the sidewalk.<br><br>
As the buildings close, released autonomous  <br> 
    feet pattern the streets<br>
    in hurry and stroll; balloon heads<br>
    drift and dive above them; the bodies  <br> 
    aren't really there.<br><br>
As the lights brighten, as the sky darkens,<br>
    a woman with crooked heels says to another woman <br>  
    while they step along at a fair pace,<br>
    "You know, I'm telling you, what I love best   <br>
    is life. I love life! Even if I ever get<br>
    to be old and wheezy—or limp! You know?   <br>
    Limping along?—I'd still ... " Out of hearing.   <br><br>
To the multiple disordered tones<br>
    of gears changing, a dance<br>
    to the compass points, out, four-way river.   <br>
    Prospect of sky<br>
    wedged into avenues, left at the ends of streets,  <br> 
    west sky, east sky: more life tonight! A range   <br>
    of open time at winter's outskirts.<br>
