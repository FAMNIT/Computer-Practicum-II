Pale gold and crumbling with crust<br>
mottled dark, almost bronze,<br>
pieces of honeycomb lie on a plate.<br>
Flecked with the pale paper<br>
of hive, their hexagonal cells<br>
leak into the deepening pool<br>
of amber. On your lips,<br>
against palate, tooth and tongue,<br>
the viscous sugar squeezes<br>
from its chambers, sears sweetness<br>
into your throat until you chew<br>
pulp and wax from a blue city<br>
of bees. Between your teeth<br>
is the blown flower and the flower's<br>
seed. Passport pages stamped<br>
and turning. Death's officious hum.<br>
Both the candle and its anther<br>
of flame. Your own yellow hunger.<br>
Never say you can't take<br>
this world into your mouth.<br>
</p><br>
