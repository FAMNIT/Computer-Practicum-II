				<h2>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h2>
				<ul>
					<li id="1910s"><strong>1914</strong> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
					<li id="1930s"><strong>1933</strong> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, <br>thanks to a Depression era program known as the "National Youth <br>Administration"</li>
					<li ><strong>1935</strong> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian <br>Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed <br>them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."</li>
					<li ><strong>1937</strong> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service</li>
					<li><strong>1938</strong> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to <br>budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study <br>under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.</li>
					<li id="1940s"><strong>1941</strong> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is <br>rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT <br>to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science.</li>
					<li><strong>1942</strong> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li>
					<li><strong>1944</strong> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his <br>pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. <br>Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease <br>resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on <br>Earth.</li>
					<li><strong>1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat <br>yields</li>
					<li id="1950s"><strong>1953</strong> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling <br>American breed, creating a strain 	that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on <br>to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</li>
					<li id="1960s"><strong>1962</strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the <br>Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly <br>expanding population</li>
					<li id="1070s"><strong>1970</strong> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
					<li><strong>1983</strong> - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and <br>sorghum yields</li>
					<li><strong>1984</strong> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</li>
					<li id="2000s"><strong>2005</strong> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." <br>Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the <br>demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not <br>inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants <br>and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science, people were <br>selecting the best breeds."</li>
					<li><strong>2009</strong> - dies at the age of 95.</li>
				</ul>
				<p><i><italian>"Borlaug's life and achievement are testimony to the far-reaching <br>contribution that one man's towering intellect, persistence and scientific <br>vision can make to human peace and progress."
				</br></br>-- Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh</i></strong></p>
