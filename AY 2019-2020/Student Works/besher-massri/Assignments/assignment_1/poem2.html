	<p title="stanza 1">
	The art of losing isn’t hard to master;
	<br>
	so many things seem filled with the intent
	<br>
	to be lost that their loss is no disaster.

	<p title="stanza 2">
	Lose something every day. Accept the fluster
	<br>
	of lost door keys, the hour badly spent.
	<br>
	The art of losing isn’t hard to master.

	<p title="stanza 3">
	Then practice losing farther, losing faster:
	<br>
	places, and names, and where it was you meant
	<br>
	to travel. None of these will bring disaster.

	<p title="stanza 4">
	I lost my mother’s watch. And look! my last, or
	<br>
	next-to-last, of three loved houses went.
	<br>
	The art of losing isn’t hard to master.

	<p title="stanza 5">
	I lost two cities, lovely ones. And, vaster,
	<br>
	some realms I owned, two rivers, a continent.
	<br>
	I miss them, but it wasn’t a disaster.

	—Even losing you (the joking voice, a gesture
	<br>
	I love) I shan’t have lied. It’s evident
	<br>
	the art of losing’s not too hard to master
	<br>
	though it may look like (Write it!) like disaster.
