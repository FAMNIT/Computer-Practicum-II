	<p title="stanza 1">
	Because I could not stop for Death –
	<br>
	He kindly stopped for me –
	<br>
	The Carriage held but just Ourselves –
	<br>
	And Immortality.

	<p title="stanza 2">
	We slowly drove – He knew no haste
	<br>
	And I had put away
	<br>
	My labor and my leisure too,
	<br>
	For His Civility –

	<p title="stanza 3">
	We passed the School, where Children strove
	<br>
	At Recess – in the Ring –
	<br>
	We passed the Fields of Gazing Grain –
	<br>
	We passed the Setting Sun –

	Or rather – He passed Us –
	<br>
	The Dews drew quivering and Chill –
	<br>
	For only Gossamer, my Gown –
	<br>
	My Tippet – only Tulle –

	<p title="stanza 5">
	We paused before a House that seemed
	<br>
	A Swelling of the Ground –
	<br>
	The Roof was scarcely visible –
	<br>
	The Cornice – in the Ground –

	<p title="stanza 6">
	Since then – 'tis Centuries – and yet
	<br>
	Feels shorter than the Day
	<br>
	I first surmised the Horses' Heads
	<br>
	Were toward Eternity –
