                        debatable. This spurred a viral form of playful vandalism where readers around the world edited
                        different implements onto Ren's lightsaber, such as this example of a Swiss Army knife.</td>

                        disorder called feline dwarfism, leaving her with a distinctive underbite that gave off a
                        pouting facial expression. This little beast became the poster cat for sarcasm and faux
                        negativity. Thousands of captioned meme photos have been created using Tardar's seemingly grumpy
                        face. Tardar, who passed away in 2019, actually was a very happy and friendly cat, which makes
                        the sarcasm memes even richer!</td>

                        that went viral. This musical meme has gotten a lot of traction since its 2013 inception.</td>
