            <h2>What are Memes</h2>
        
            <p>An Internet meme, more commonly known simply as a meme (/miÀêm/ MEEM), is a type of meme which is spread
                 via the Internet, often through social media platforms. Colloquially, the term may also refer specifically
                  to pieces of media that take the general format of such memes, traditionally but not exclusively combining 
                  image macros with a concept or catchphrase. These traditional types of memes can be very simplistic, 
                  often featuring a single word or phrase. In some cases these words and phrases contain intentional misspellings
                   (such as locates) or incorrect grammar (such as doge and "All your base are belong to us"). 
                   However, in more recent times, memes have evolved from simple image macros with text to more 
                   elaborate things such as challenges, GIFs and viral sensations. Their evolution has made it uncommon
                    to go anywhere nowadays without seeing some form of meme. These small movements tend to spread from 
                    person to person via social networks, blogs, direct email, or news sources. They may relate to various 
                    existing Internet cultures or subcultures, often created or spread on various websites. Fads and sensations
                     tend to grow rapidly on the Internet because the instant communication facilitates word of mouth transmission.
                      Some examples include posting a photo of people lying down in public places (called "planking") and uploading
                       a short video of people doing the Harlem Shake.</p>
