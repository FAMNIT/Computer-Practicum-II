				<td class="meme-description">"Loss", sometimes referred to as "Loss.jpg", is a webcomic strip created on June 2, 2008 by Tim Buckley for his gaming-related webcomic Ctrl+Alt+Del. During a storyline where the main character Ethan and his fiancée Lilah are expecting their first child, the strip—presented as a four-panel comic with no dialogue—has Ethan entering a hospital, asking a receptionist for directions, talking to a doctor, and finding Lilah crying on her side in a hospital bed, implying that she had suffered a miscarriage. Buckley cited personal events in his life as inspiration for the comic.Since the publication of the strip, it has garnered negative reception from critics and webcomic creators, noting the shift in tone in the webcomic as an example of "fridging". It later garnered a legacy as an internet meme, with edits to the strip being made by other creators.</td>
