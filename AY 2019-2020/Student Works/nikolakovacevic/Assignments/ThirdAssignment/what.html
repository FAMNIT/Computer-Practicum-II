			<h1>What are memes?</h1>

		<article>
			<p>A meme is an idea, behavior, or style that spreads by means of imitation from person to person within a cultureâ€”often with the aim of conveying a<br> particular phenomenon, theme, or meaning represented by the meme. A meme acts as a unit for carrying cultural ideas, symbols, or practices, that can be<br> transmitted from one mind to another through writing, speech, gestures, rituals, or other imitable phenomena with a mimicked theme. Supporters of the<br> concept regard memes as cultural analogues to genes in that they self-replicate, mutate, and respond to selective pressures.
			Proponents theorize that memes<br> are a viral phenomenon that may evolve by natural selection in a manner analogous to that of biological evolution. Memes do this through the processes of<br> variation, mutation, competition, and inheritance, each of which influences a meme's reproductive success. Memes spread through the behavior that they<br> generate in their hosts. Memes that propagate less prolifically may become extinct, while others may survive, spread, and (for better or for worse) mutate.<br> Memes that replicate most effectively enjoy more success, and some may replicate effectively even when they prove to be detrimental to the welfare of their<br> hosts.
			A field of study called memetics arose in the 1990s to explore the concepts and transmission of memes in terms of an evolutionary model. Criticism<br> from a variety of fronts has challenged the notion that academic study can examine memes empirically. However, developments in neuroimaging may make<br> empirical study possible. Some commentators in the social sciences question the idea that one can meaningfully categorize culture in terms of discrete units,<br> and are especially critical of the biological nature of the theory's underpinnings. Others have argued that this use of the term is the result of a<br> misunderstanding of the original proposal.

			The word meme is a neologism coined by Richard Dawkins. It originated from Dawkins's 1976 book The Selfish<br> Gene. Dawkins's own position is somewhat ambiguous: he welcomed N. K. Humphrey's suggestion that "memes should be considered as living structures,<br> not just metaphorically" and proposed to regard memes as "physically residing in the brain". Later, he argued that his original intentions, presumably before<br> his approval of Humphrey's opinion, had been simpler.<br>
