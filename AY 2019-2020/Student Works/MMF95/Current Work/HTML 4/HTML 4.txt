HTML Forms
just take 2 hours max (including breaks)

forms are meant to recreate our physical forms
the goal of html forms is for us to input data
forms are as well submitted


by the end of todays session
we will have two pages
one page with html form
and another page where "you submit your data"

this is basically our preview for PHP
PHP is a scripting technology that allows us to receive, process and display data from forms


the early days of facebook were created in php
input type text has default 20 characters

Form method
GET - to make bookmarks
POST - to make secure confidential or private data
