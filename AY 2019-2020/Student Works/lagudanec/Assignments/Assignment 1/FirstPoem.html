				 When that I was and a little tiny boy,<br>
   			     With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,<br>
			     A foolish thing was but a toy,<br>
    		     For the rain it raineth every day.<br></p>
    		   <br>
    		<p><img src="images.jfif" width=100 align="left">
    		   But when I came to man’s estate,<br>
    		   With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,<br>
			   ’Gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate,<br>
    		   For the rain it raineth every day.<br></p>

    		   But when I came, alas! to wive,<br>
    		   With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,<br>
			   By swaggering could I never thrive,<br>
    		   For the rain it raineth every day.<br></p>

    		   But when I came unto my beds,<br>
    	       With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,<br>
			   With toss-pots still had drunken heads,<br>
    		   For the rain it raineth every day.<br></p>
