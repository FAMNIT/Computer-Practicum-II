				Good fellows all,<br>
				The latest of my wealth I'll share amongst you.<br>
				Wherever we shall meet, for Timon's sake,<br>
				Let's yet be fellows; let's shake our heads, and say,<br>
				As 'twere a knell unto our master's fortunes,<br>
				'We have seen better days.' Let each take some;<br>
				Nay, put out all your hands. Not one word more:<br>
				Thus part we rich in sorrow, parting poor<br></p>

			O, the fierce wretchedness that glory brings us!<br>
			Who would not wish to be from wealth exempt,<br>
			Since riches point to misery and contempt?<br>
			Who would be so mock'd with glory? or to live<br>
			But in a dream of friendship?<br><p>

			To have his pomp and all what state compounds<br>
			But only painted, like his varnish'd friends?<br>
			Poor honest lord, brought low by his own heart,<br>
			Undone by goodness! Strange, unusual blood,<br>
			When man's worst sin is, he does too much good!<br>
			Who, then, dares to be half so kind again?<br><p>

		   	For bounty, that makes gods, does still mar men.<br>
			My dearest lord, bless'd, to be most accursed,<br>
			Rich, only to be wretched, thy great fortunes<br>
			Are made thy chief afflictions. Alas, kind lord!<br>
			He's flung in rage from this ingrateful seat<br>
			Of monstrous friends, nor has he with him to<br>
			Supply his life, or that which can command it.<br>
			I'll follow and inquire him out:<br>
			I'll ever serve his mind with my best will;<br>
			Whilst I have gold, I'll be his steward still.<br><p>
