   <p align="right">A short poem has recently been “doing the rounds” on various social media platforms. And it’s about carrots. It’s also quite, quite brilliant.Moving stuff, right? Now, aside from the fact that this is probably the best poem ever written about carrots, it’s more than just a social media oddity to be marvelled at – perhaps even laughed at (who would laugh at a poem about carrots?) Obviously, because the poem is so short, there’s not so much text available that can have much context.Literature, as the record of universal experience, has gradually acquired certain symbols that have become conventionalized–a kind of stage property of poets and artists and common people. The lily is a symbol of purity, the eagle of strength, red of passion, and gray of peace.</p>

   <p style="color:dark gray;" align="right">HA JIN</p><br>
   <p align="right">In A Center Ha Jin explores the experience of disillusionment and solitude for those who have chosen to or are forced to leave their native land, as they live in the memory or re-imagination of that “distant center”.He raises the question of the meaning of fulfillment for a writer and the overwhelming importance placed on him by the world.Hoping to reconcile the tension between the writer’s happiness as an individual and his contribution to the world, he imagines how he’d like others to remember him with a gentle, lenient heart.Some of the most powerful poems in the collection center around the complexity of one’s sense of allegiance to one’s people, land or country. “All you have is your country” questions the meaning of a country to an individual, unrealistic desire to return: “as long as you live, you want to grieve for the fairy tale of patriotism.”</p>
