                    <td class="Description">Bill is a stick-person illustration with white space left for captioning. The version pictured here is Bill wearing a hat. There are also versions of Bill sitting at a computer.Bill lets you make passive-aggressive public judgments about other people's life choices — an all-too irresistible appeal in modern society. To comment on something you disagree with, the innocuous Bill stick figure is an easy way to transmit your message.</td>

					<td class="Name">Doge! Much wow, Such fun...</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="Description">Doge is a photograph meme commonly attached to pictures of Shiba Inu dogs, combined with the Comic Sans font and the use of bad grammar with comedic monologue text. Doge even inspired the name of a new type of digital currency called Dogecoins.Doge has two common pronunciations: as a rhyme with rogue, or pronounced as dohj.</td>

					<td rowspan="2"><img src="Meme3.jpg"></td>
					<td class="Name">Distracted Boyfriend</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="Description">“Distracted boyfriend” first entered the meme game in 2017, when a Turkish Facebook group used a stock photo of a man walking with a girl while checking out another girl to make a joke about Phil Collins. The meme continues to be relevant today while being used as inspiration for pop culture references, such as this recent one involving "Queer Eye's" Antoni Porowski, and new celebrity couple Kate Beckinsale and Pete Davidson at a New York Rangers game.</td>

				<tr>
					<td rowspan="2"><img src="Meme4.jpg"></td>
					<td class="Name">Expanding Brain</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="Description">In 2017, when a number of posters on Tumblr and 4chan started bragging about their brain sizes, it quickly turned into a meme. Photos of different sized brains are paired with “smart” sounding words until they expand into a fully enlightened stage. One of the first manifestations of the “expanding brain” meme came from the who-whom-whomst progression of words that seemingly makes one sound smarter.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td rowspan="2"><img src="Meme5.jpg"></td>
					<td class="Name">Change My mind</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="Description">After Steven Crowder, a conservative podcaster, posted a photo of himself in 2018 sitting at a desk with a sign saying “Male privilege is a myth: Change my mind,” it was almost too easy for the internet to begin making fun of him with memes of their own. Memes ranged from simply changing the words on the sign to elaborate photoshops.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td rowspan="2"><img src="Meme6.jpg"></td>
					<td class="Name">Drake</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="Description">Drake has been the subject of several different memes throughout his long career. His 2015 single “Hotline Bling” was one of the biggest songs of the year, and when the music video came out featuring Drake dancing in a brightly lit cube structure the memes began to accumulate even more. Since then the internet has memed everything from his Twitter posts to school portraits.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td rowspan="2"><img src="Meme7.jpg"></td>
					<td class="Name">This is fine</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="Description">Taken out of a 2013 webcomic strip called “On Fire,” this image showing a human-like dog enjoying his coffee while his house is burning down has seemingly become more and more relatable every year. The image is rarely altered, simply attached to troubling or hard-to-grasp news.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td rowspan="2"><img src="Meme8.jpg"></td>
					<td class="Name">Don't say it</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="Description">The “don't say it” meme details the relatable conversations people have between themselves and their brains, from bringing up awkward conversations topics to resisting “that's what she said” jokes. The first tweet with the meme showed up in 2010, but later resurfaced in 2017 and showed an inner struggle between whether or not to start a conversation with a taxi driver.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td rowspan="2"><img src="Meme9.jpg"></td>
					<td class="Name">HandShake</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="Description">The 1987 film “Predator” starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Carl Weathers contained within it what could be the manliest handshake of all time, and in 2007 it began gaining traction on YouTube. After multiple videos and fan art paying tribute to the handshake became popular in the following years, object labeling memes using the handshake as a background to agreements began to arise in 2018.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td rowspan="2"><img src="Meme10.jpg"></td>
					<td class="Name">Elon Musk</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="Description">There have been several memes revolving around the tech entrepreneur Elon Musk throughout the years, especially following his Twitter request for “dank memes” in October 2018. One of the most popular Musk memes uses an image of the billionaire smoking during a podcast interview.</td>
