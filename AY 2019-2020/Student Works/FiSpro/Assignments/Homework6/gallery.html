The photo pictured her then 11 mo. old son Sammy on a beach, clutching a fist full of sand. The image soon spread throughout the web, often accompanied by captions reflecting sentiments of either success or frustration (he's also commonly known as 'I Hate Sandcastles Kid).</td>

A bunch of media coverage (and quite a bit of admiration from us folks at HubSpot -- and likely elsewhere).
