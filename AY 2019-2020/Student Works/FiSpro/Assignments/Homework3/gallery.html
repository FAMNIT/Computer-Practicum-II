The photo pictured her then 11 mo. old son Sammy on a beach, clutching a fist full of sand. The image soon spread throughout the web, often accompanied by captions reflecting sentiments of either success or frustration (he's also commonly known as 'I Hate Sandcastles Kid).</td>

The picture, which features Rubio's two chihuahuas, Bogie and Kima, and Bogie holding a business card in his mouth reading "Adopt Me, Maybe?" has generated 370,000 views since it was posted ... which was just several days ago. Rubio's goal is to encourage prospective dog owners to adopt instead of purchasing their four-legged friends from a pet store.</td>

Instead, SEOmoz made its announcement with the aid of a series of popular internet memes. The result? A bunch of media coverage (and quite a bit of admiration from us folks at HubSpot -- and likely elsewhere).
