      <p><img src = "page2a.jpg" width = 170 align = "left"> Memories in my life fade away <br>
      As I replace them with others.<br>
      They are forgotten and stored away.<br>
      Although the memories are pushed to the side,<br>
      They are safe so I may remember them in the future.<br>
      Our mind is like a book;<br> <br> </p>
      <p><img src = "page2b.jpg" width = 130 align = "left">It writes down important things and keeps them between the pages forever.<br>
      Maybe our whole album of memories:<br>
      Our first steps, first love, first grief, and others<br>
      Were meant to be there for us to never forget.<br> </p>
