      <p><img src = "poem1a.jpg" width = 100 align = "left"> I come with no wrapping or pretty pink bows. <br>
      I am who I am, from my head to my toes. <br>
      I tend to get loud when speaking my mind.<br>
      Even a little crazy some of the time.<br>
      I'm not a size 5 and don't care to be.<br>
      You can be you and I can be me.<br><br> </p>

      <p><img src = "poem1b.jpg" width = 100 align = "left"><br> I try to stay strong when pain knocks me down.<br>
      And the times that I cry are when no one's around.<br>
      To error is human or so that's what they say.<br>
      Well, tell me who's perfect anyway.<br> </p> <br>
