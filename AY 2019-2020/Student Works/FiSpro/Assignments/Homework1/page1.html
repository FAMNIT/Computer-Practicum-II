      I am unique. I try to instill in my daughters that we all are unique. <br>
      Find yourself and be   proud of who you are.

      This poem is about all our memories being there for us when we want to remember.<br>
      Although memories may fade away, they are never gone. Some are pushed to the side, <br> 
      so we may remember them in the future.
