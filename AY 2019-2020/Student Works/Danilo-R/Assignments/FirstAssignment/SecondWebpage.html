	<h4>Stanza 1</h4>
	<img src = "poemOne_stanzaOne.jpg" height = "100" width = "100" align = "left">
	<p>We, unaccustomed to courage<br>
		exiles from delight<br>
		live coiled in shells of loneliness<br>
		until love leaves its high holy temple<br>
		and comes into our sight<br>
		to liberate us into life</p>
	<br>

	<h4>Stanza 2</h4>
	<img src = "poemOne_stanzaTwo.jpg" height = "120" width = "120" align = "left">
	<p>Love arrives<br>
		and in its train come ecstasies<br>
		old memories of pleasure<br>
		ancient histories of pain.<br>
		Yet if we are bold,<br>
		love strikes away the chains of fear<br>
		from our souls.</p>
	<br>

	<h4>Stanza 3</h4>
	<img src = "poemOne_stanzaThree.jpg" height = "140" width = "140" align = "left">
	<p>We are weaned from our timidity<br>
		In the flush of love's light<br>
		we dare be brave<br>
		And suddenly we see<br>
		that love costs all we are<br>
		and will ever be.<br>
		Yet it is only love<br>
		which sets us free.</p>
