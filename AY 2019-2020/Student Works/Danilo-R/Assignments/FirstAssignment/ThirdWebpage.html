	<p>Whose woods these are I think I know.<br>
		His house is in the village though;<br>
		He will not see me stopping here<br>
		To watch his woods fill up with snow.</p>
	<br>

	<h4>Stanza 2</h4>

	<p>My little horse must think it queer<br>
		To stop without a farmhouse near<br>
		Between the woods and frozen lake<br>
		The darkest evening of the year.</p>
	<br>

	<h4>Stanza 3</h4>
	<img src = "poemTwo_stanzaThree.jpg" height = "70" width = "70" align = "left">
	<p>He gives his harness bells a shake<br>
		To ask if there is some mistake.<br>
		The only other sounds's the sweep<br>
		Of easy wind and downy flake.</p>
	<br>

	<h4>Stanza 4</h4>
	<img src = "poemTwo_stanzaFour.jpg" height = "70" width = "70" align = "left">
	<p>The woods are lovely, dark and deep,<br>
		But I have promises to keep,<br>
		And miles to go before I sleep,<br>
		And miles to go before I Sleep.</p>
