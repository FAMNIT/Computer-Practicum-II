	<h3>"Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening"</h3>
	</a>
	<h4>Author</h4>

	</a>
	<h4>Description</h4>
	<p>The poem is ever-inviting, yet possesses a dark underlying connotation as well.<br>
		It narrates the account of one man standing deep in the woods torn between two choices.<br>
		The woods are immensely thick, dark and stand in all their glory. It intrinsically denotes certain characteristics of the human being.<br>
		He toys with the unknown, in this case, death, facing beauty in the face of imminent danger and quite possibly, a death wish.</p>
