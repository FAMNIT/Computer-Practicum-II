we use node js to deploy a server
server is a program that handles the request of your clients
today we will setup our local node js server
we are going to use localhost
we will setup something that can receive requests from the clients
part of the clients will be discussed next week 
setup server
he teach it on how to handle requests over the internet

local computer > files
world wide web > files

var http = require('http');
^ variable  ^ require() this is a nodejs function 
     ^ http is the name of the variable
>> if you have to contact the server then it should have http
>> if I use https it's not gonna work 

http.createServer( function here { } ).listen(8080);
^ this creates a server and has a port that listens to port 8080

res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});
 ^ give a response, write it in the Header, 
 200 is ok, content of html
	res.end('Hello World!');


To test the server and turn it on
Go to terminal/command prompt
go to the current location of your file (and nodejs)
C:/Users/Jordan/
cd C:\Users\Jordan

Users/Jordan

To test your server and to test node js

node <filename.js>
node test.js

To turn off your server 

one way is to Ctrl C 

What happened here:
Node JS ran the script found in test.js
It happens that test.js should "display" some text in a webpage

Your server is up and running

HTTP = hypertext transfer protocol
this allows the transfer and display of webpages over the internet

GET vs POST form names pass these values using nodejs because of the http

Query (queries) = requests


http.createServer(function(req, res){
	res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});
	var q = url.parse(req.url, true).query;
	var txt = q.name + " " + q.date;
	res.end(txt);
}).listen(8080);

//to test this code 
//turn on server and enter the url below in the browser
//http://localhost:8080/?year=2020&month=May
// from the GET method in the HTML probably from a previous page
